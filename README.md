# easy_queue
This is a PHP project with redis list as the core. It mainly provides multi-process functions. It is for PHPer who does not know about Java multi-threaded project as well as me. I would like you to participate in the maintenance together with me. The framework used in this project is also developed in imitation of ThinkPHP mode, which is not very friendly for HTML part
